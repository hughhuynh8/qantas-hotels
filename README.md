## Approach

Began with TDD. Wrote unit tests for Header, Sort and Summary before implementing those components
Used REST API to get product JSON data.


## Trade-offs

Ran out of time so didn't write unit tests for other components.
In hindsight, would have used Material UI from the start instead of Bootstrap with some Material.
If time permitted, would have styled components properly with SASS, using variables for colours, fonts, etc, and removed inline styling.
